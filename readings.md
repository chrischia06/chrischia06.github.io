How fast should we trade

The aim is to maximise expected returns after costs



Total cost per year = Holding cost + (Trading cost * Number of trades)

+ Execution costs

Absence of autocorrelations
Heavy tails
Gain/Loss asymmetry - large drawdowns but not equally larget upward movements
Aggregational Gaussianity
intermeittency
Volatility Clustering
Conditional heavy tails
slow decay of absolute returns - long range dependence
Leverage effect - measures of vol negatively correlated with asset returns
Volume/vol correlation
Asymmetry in time scales
