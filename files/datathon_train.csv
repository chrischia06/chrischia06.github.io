I have emailed the lecturer asking for reconsideration but so far I haven't heard anything back. I have also read section 9 of the academic manual but there isn't a clear procedure on how to deal with plagiarism or academic misconducts in group work. The lecturer just picked the lazy way and punished everyone in the group, even the innocent ones. What should I do now to prove my own innocence???",,1,4,0

2020-01-15 08:54:23,I haven't really got anyone else I can talk to about this about so here goes. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for four years but I don't know if I'm happy anymore. I still enjoy spending time with her but I'm not sure if I love her anymore. I think she loves me more than she ever has which is why this is difficult. I… More feel like it would crush her if we broke up and she's already really struggling at her uni with making friends and mental health so I don't want to hurt her more. At the same time I don't think I really want us to have a future anymore and staying in the relationship is causing me stress. We both only really have each other for support. I think being in a relationship has restricted both of us in making friends and a social life without the other one. I still really care about her so want to do what's best for both of us. can anyone help?,,4,2,0

2019-06-10 02:30:37,"Why are gender identity and sexuality grouped under the same term 'LGBTQ+'. I say this as a gay man who is a supporter of the trans community. While both communities still have a long way to go in terms of equality, the LGB definitely has a lot more recognition and has received a lot more attention in recent years, whilst I feel it is… More much harder to be a member of the trans community in today's society. I worry that we hail LGBT progress when we are actually only really seeing progress for the LGB community and the trans community is being left behind. But because they all come under the same banner we forget about trans issues. Also sexuality and gender identity are two completely separate issues. Yes, gay people can support the trans community (and vice versa) but we will never truly understand what it means to question your gender identity. The label LGBTQ+ feels to me like ""Oh these people aren't 'normal' let's shove them all under the same label"".",,21,6,0

To top it all off, there are 2 exams in particular (out of the remaining ones I have) which I'm so anxious about (I've had a few breakdowns, periods of negative thoughts, etc.) that I continue to procrastinate studying for them, and whenever I do sit down to try and do work for those modules, I just mentally can't bring myself to do it because of how fearful I feel.

You may think that the debate is ""stupid"" because you worked hard at private school but this argument is not based off of how hard we all… More worked. You have to work hard to get into top universities like UCL whether you went to private school or state school. There is no argument about that. However, the standard that state schools are held to is much lower than that which private schools are held to, meaning that students are not given the same opportunities and their educational experience does not match that which is given in private schools. I get that a lot of people are making this debate about hard work, admittedly because a lot of us are jealous of the increased opportunities available to students who go to private schools, but it is inherently about equality of opportunity.",,1,0,0

The… More resulting chemicals can then be separated and sold to chemical plants for the production of beauty products, solvents, pharmaceuticals and new plastics. This would stop plastic from piling up in landfills and entering our rivers and oceans, stop millions of tons of CO2 from being created through plastic incineration and reduce the need for new oil extraction.

I wish we talked more about how fucked up it is when you know someone in your course raped a friend who is too afraid to come forward because she was drunk and is dealing with her own trauma. It's so hard to see how much she suffers and how he's going through life completely… More unaffected by what happened that night. I know he's going to be successful and influential whilst those who know what happened and how awful a person he is just watch on in disgust. It's so fucking awful that victims are asked to essentially sacrifice their emotional and mental well-being for a shot at justice. There's nothing anyone can do unless she comes forward but she seems to be healing so much more now that she's made the decision to not do anything.

Many mainlanders actually are not sure what is really going on and they also question about the news from both of the sides. but they don’t post much and don’t talk too much to strangers. That’s probably why you have a stereotype of mainlanders are sort of nationalists. Please don’t attack or insult others like that. It hurts.

2018-11-11 20:46:44,"Today I attempted to insert a whole cantaloupe melon into my anus because the local shops had run out of apricots (I buy a lot). Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing… More because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.",,17,26,1

My friends are helpful and good at distracting me but I’m scared to confide in my girlfriend because I don’t think she will understand (also don’t want to scare her off) and I don’t want to tell my parents because they’ll just get worried.

Adults are adults and they should be held accountable for their decisions. If they were children, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. In this world, we are judged by our decisions. It's perfectly fine to judge someone who voted for Brexit. It was their decision. Yes, politicians were misleading.

Every time you listen through again, you hear something new and and realise just how much betrayal and just pure shit she's had to take from men in her life for the past decade. Just the fact that so many tracks sound happy while having lyrics that are depressing as hell is so damn poetic and I relate to it so deeply. 2017 was the year of revival for old pop punk and emo bands, and Paramore definately led the way, I'm so sad they didn't receive the recognition they deserved.",,13,6,0
