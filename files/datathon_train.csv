2019-11-28 22:15:07,"So I like a guy who‚Äôs probably attracted to me but hasn‚Äôt figured out the nature of relationships yet. He thinks he‚Äôll find a girl who‚Äôs literally perfect and checks every box on his list (which is pretty much impossible). Ergo, he‚Äôs a little immature. He‚Äôs almost waiting for a Disney princess to show up and be seduced by him. On the‚Ä¶ More other hand, we‚Äôve been friends since forever, and always gravitated towards each other. Lately, he has become flirtier than before but still a long wait to go. It‚Äôs a pretty painful process for me, I‚Äôm almost in the friendzone but I can‚Äôt let him go, because whenever we meet, he‚Äôs flirting unconsciously. Ladies, who‚Äôs been in a similar situation, should I run or is it worth waiting?",,0,1,0

The‚Ä¶ More resulting chemicals can then be separated and sold to chemical plants for the production of beauty products, solvents, pharmaceuticals and new plastics.

While both communities still have a long way to go in terms of equality, the LGB definitely has a lot more recognition and has received a lot more attention in recent years, whilst I feel it is‚Ä¶ More much harder to be a member of the trans community in today's society. I worry that we hail LGBT progress when we are actually only really seeing progress for the LGB community and the trans community is being left behind. But because they all come under the same banner we forget about trans issues. Also sexuality and gender identity are two completely separate issues. Yes, gay people can support the trans community (and vice versa) but we will never truly understand what it means to question your gender identity.

Adults are adults and they should be held accountable for their decisions. If they were children, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. In this world, we are judged by our decisions. It's perfectly fine to judge someone who voted for Brexit. It was their decision. Yes, politicians were misleading.

This is where things got confusing‚Ä¶ More because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots.

You have to work hard to get into top universities like UCL whether you went to private school or state school. There is no argument about that. However, the standard that state schools are held to is much lower than that which private schools are held to, meaning that students are not given the same opportunities and their educational experience does not match that which is given in private schools. I get that a lot of people are making this debate about hard work, admittedly because a lot of us are jealous of the increased opportunities available to students who go to private schools, but it is inherently about equality of opportunity.",,1,0,0

And I see no reason as to why white people cannot fit into that. Yes, obviously it isn't structural racism like I said, but there are people who joke about white people but then become sensitive when people make jokes about their own race.
