You have to work hard to get into top universities like UCL whether you went to private school or state school. There is no argument about that. However, the standard that state schools are held to is much lower than that which private schools are held to, meaning that students are not given the same opportunities and their educational experience does not match that which is given in private schools. I get that a lot of people are making this debate about hard work, admittedly because a lot of us are jealous of the increased opportunities available to students who go to private schools, but it is inherently about equality of opportunity.",,1,0,0

To top it all off, there are 2 exams in particular (out of the remaining ones I have) which I'm so anxious about (I've had a few breakdowns, periods of negative thoughts, etc.) that I continue to procrastinate studying for them, and whenever I do sit down to try and do work for those modules, I just mentally can't bring myself to do it because of how fearful I feel.

2020-01-15 08:54:23,I haven't really got anyone else I can talk to about this about so here goes. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for four years but I don't know if I'm happy anymore. I still enjoy spending time with her but I'm not sure if I love her anymore. I think she loves me more than she ever has which is why this is difficult. I‚Ä¶ More feel like it would crush her if we broke up and she's already really struggling at her uni with making friends and mental health so I don't want to hurt her more. At the same time I don't think I really want us to have a future anymore and staying in the relationship is causing me stress. We both only really have each other for support. I think being in a relationship has restricted both of us in making friends and a social life without the other one. I still really care about her so want to do what's best for both of us. can anyone help?,,4,2,0

Google says the definition of racism is:‚Ä¶ More prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. And I see no reason as to why white people cannot fit into that. Yes, obviously it isn't structural racism like I said, but there are people who joke about white people but then become sensitive when people make jokes about their own race.

Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out. This is where things got confusing‚Ä¶ More because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere. I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.",,17,26,1

I, as an EU citizen, really don't have to be understanding of those people. Moreover, don't you think it's a bit offensive that you seem to be suggesting that because of someone's socio-economic background they wouldn't be able to make proper decisions. Adults are adults and they should be held accountable for their decisions. If they were children, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. In this world, we are judged by our decisions. It's perfectly fine to judge someone who voted for Brexit. It was their decision. Yes, politicians were misleading.

I have emailed the lecturer asking for reconsideration but so far I haven't heard anything back. I have also read section 9 of the academic manual but there isn't a clear procedure on how to deal with plagiarism or academic misconducts in group work.

But 'bodypositivity' can also lead to the trap of embracing an unhealthy life. Being very overweight has clear‚Ä¶ More risks and dangers associated with it, not to mention costs to others in the form of socialized healthcare. It's fine to be positive about yourself, but it would be foolish to use that as a reason to do nothing about your weight. Pretending that there's no problem, or implying that being overweight is just ""another shape"" is wrong, because that involves lying to yourself and to others.

I worry that we hail LGBT progress when we are actually only really seeing progress for the LGB community and the trans community is being left behind. But because they all come under the same banner we forget about trans issues. Also sexuality and gender identity are two completely separate issues. Yes, gay people can support the trans community (and vice versa) but we will never truly understand what it means to question your gender identity.
