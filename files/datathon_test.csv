It's fine to be positive about yourself, but it would be foolish to use that as a reason to do nothing about your weight.

2020-01-13 19:13:47,Trigger Warning: mentions of rape/sexual harassment . . . . I wish we talked more about how fucked up it is when you know someone in your course raped a friend who is too afraid to come forward because she was drunk and is dealing with her own trauma. It's so hard to see how much she suffers and how he's going through life completely‚Ä¶ More unaffected by what happened that night. I know he's going to be successful and influential whilst those who know what happened and how awful a person he is just watch on in disgust. It's so fucking awful that victims are asked to essentially sacrifice their emotional and mental well-being for a shot at justice. There's nothing anyone can do unless she comes forward but she seems to be healing so much more now that she's made the decision to not do anything. Sometimes I feel like exploding with rage when I see how much it hangs over her every single minute of every single day.,,12,6
