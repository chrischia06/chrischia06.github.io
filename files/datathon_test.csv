My idea is to take waste plastics from landfills, and un-recyclable plastics from sorting centers and turn them back into the oil using a process known as pyrolysis. The‚Ä¶ More resulting chemicals can then be separated and sold to chemical plants for the production of beauty products, solvents, pharmaceuticals and new plastics. This would stop plastic from piling up in landfills and entering our rivers and oceans, stop millions of tons of CO2 from being created through plastic incineration and reduce the need for new oil extraction.
