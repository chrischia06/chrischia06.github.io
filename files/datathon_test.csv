2018-09-23 17:40:21,"> Since there's been some posts about body positivity, as well as some news articles, I thought I would say this: I know it's a sensitive issue for people, and of course no one should have to feel awful about their image. But 'bodypositivity' can also lead to the trap of embracing an unhealthy life. Being very overweight has clear‚Ä¶ More risks and dangers associated with it, not to mention costs to others in the form of socialized healthcare. It's fine to be positive about yourself, but it would be foolish to use that as a reason to do nothing about your weight. Pretending that there's no problem, or implying that being overweight is just ""another shape"" is wrong, because that involves lying to yourself and to others. Being honest with yourself is the first step towards living a healthier life. Sources: I was reasonably overweight for a number of years.",,6,3
