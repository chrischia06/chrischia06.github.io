**TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning**



Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem

Personally not that useful, but could be a good introduction for beginners for typical classification/regression modelling style problems. A very applied book, just like Geron's Hands on Machine Learning with scikit-learn and Tensorflow.
