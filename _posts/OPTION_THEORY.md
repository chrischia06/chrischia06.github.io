### Statistical Learning approaches to Mean-Variance Hedging

Refers to using *statistical approaches* as opposed to model-based approaches for derivatives hedging.

+ Learns a regularised network with a spline kernel from empirical data. Uses moneyness, time to maturity and the black-scholes delta as inputs. Compares different kernels, and learning the price and taking partials.

> To calculatethe MV delta,it is necessary to use the model to determinethe expected change in the option price arising from boththe change in the underlying asset andthe associated expected change in its volatility

+ http://www.risknet.eu/fileadmin/eLibrary/Taleb-Illusions-dynamic-replication-2005.pdf
+ Black and Scholes (1973) presents dynamic replication.
+ Dynamic replication requires continuous trading (non-existent), and the same pricing formula is used for a variety of underlyings.
+ Black-Scholes-Merton depends on : constant, known implied vol $\sigma$, constant and known risk free rate $r$, no transaction costs, frictionless markets
+ Put-Call Parity
