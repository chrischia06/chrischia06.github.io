# Dynamic Hedging

## Derman, E., Taleb, N.N., The illusions of dynamic replication (2005)

+ http://www.risknet.eu/fileadmin/eLibrary/Taleb-Illusions-dynamic-replication-2005.pdf
+ Black and Scholes (1973) presents dynamic replication.
+ Dynamic replication requires continuous trading (non-existent), and the same pricing formula is used for a variety of underlyings.
+ Black-Scholes-Merton depends on : constant, known implied vol $\sigma$, constant and known risk free rate $r$, no transaction costs, frictionless markets
+ Put-Call Parity
