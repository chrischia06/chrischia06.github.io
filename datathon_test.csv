I want to thank you for agreeing to watch shitty reality shows with me and‚Ä¶ More letting me pick the songs during car rides even though we have completely different tastes. I want to thank you for all of the hugs you have offered me to squeeze the sadness out and all of the pep talks you have given me when I doubted myself. Most of all, I want to thank you for existing.

We got one half of the Farro brothers back, but little did we know that Hayley's marriage was virtually over and that she's been dealing with major anxiety over the past 3 years after selftitled reached major pop radio highs and‚Ä¶ More she's afraid she has peaked - her lyrics were raw, honest and totally heartbreaking, while the synths and beats throughout were totally bop-worthy. Every time you listen through again, you hear something new and and realise just how much betrayal and just pure shit she's had to take from men in her life for the past decade. Just the fact that so many tracks sound happy while having lyrics that are depressing as hell is so damn poetic and I relate to it so deeply. 2017 was the year of revival for old pop punk and emo bands, and Paramore definately led the way, I'm so sad they didn't receive the recognition they deserved.",,13,6

I have some straight guy friends I want to be more platonically close to, but I can't help worrying about trash related to how ""guys and girls can't be just friends"". These ideas have‚Ä¶ More been engraved into my brain throughout my childhood and adolescence by classmates teasing me about having crushes on guys I was friendly with when I never had crushes on them. Back then, my immature brain didn't dismiss the teasing as not worth having negative emotions for, so every time I was teased like that, I felt upset. I ended up associating my experiences with negative emotion. I don't want to be afraid anymore. I don't want to worry about falling for my guy friends. I don't want to worry about them falling for me. I don't want to worry about all of this trash from my childhood. Any advice would be appreciated.",,2,5
