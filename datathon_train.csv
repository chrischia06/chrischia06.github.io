Do you think all people would acquiesce and let you distort all the speeches in the name of ‘freedom’? Just some simple facts about this riot which you may verify on fb videos if you want. 1. The protectors/rioters set university… More campuses and streets on fire. (Arson) 2. They killed a dissendent, hitting a 70 year old man with a brick in his head leaving him in ICU braindead. (Murder) 3. They set fire on a dissendent. ( Attemped Murder) 4. They menaced the police’s children who are still in schools. I acknowledge that freedom is an ideal pursuit, BUT #Freedom does not mean setting people on fire# #Freedom does not mean setting schools on fire# People do look on news from both sides and most importantly if you don’t believe either, look at third party You may want to watch Deustche Welle’s interview on their ‘leader’ before making your judgment. #A mainlander who is also, perhaps surprisingly lol, versed in John Stuart Mill, Bentham and John Rawls",,35,28,0

My idea is to take waste plastics from landfills, and un-recyclable plastics from sorting centers and turn them back into the oil using a process known as pyrolysis. The… More resulting chemicals can then be separated and sold to chemical plants for the production of beauty products, solvents, pharmaceuticals and new plastics. This would stop plastic from piling up in landfills and entering our rivers and oceans, stop millions of tons of CO2 from being created through plastic incineration and reduce the need for new oil extraction.

Free Palestine is to stand with our fellow brothers and… More sisters against this injustice, it is not anti-Semitic- the judgement or prejudice of Jews, it is anti hate, anti murder. The occupation of Palestine by Israeli forces is unlawful, people are being kicked out of their homes, people are not allowed to go to the mosque to pray, being are bombed during the holiest month. People are fighting everyday to be who they are without judgement. Free Palestine is not exclusively against Jews it is against the inhumane actions occuring everyday. Even Jews say free Palestine. It's not against Jews but against the treatment of the Palestinian people. They're humans who deserve the freedom to live too. FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸",,55,5,0

For example, the one starting with ""Maybe if you stepped off your high horse to examine the harsh… More economic conditions of those who voted for Brexit"". I, as an EU citizen, really don't have to be understanding of those people. Moreover, don't you think it's a bit offensive that you seem to be suggesting that because of someone's socio-economic background they wouldn't be able to make proper decisions. Adults are adults and they should be held accountable for their decisions. If they were children, they wouldn't be allowed to vote. In this world, we are judged by our decisions. It's perfectly fine to judge someone who voted for Brexit. It was their decision. Yes, politicians were misleading.

While both communities still have a long way to go in terms of equality, the LGB definitely has a lot more recognition and has received a lot more attention in recent years, whilst I feel it is… More much harder to be a member of the trans community in today's society. I worry that we hail LGBT progress when we are actually only really seeing progress for the LGB community and the trans community is being left behind. But because they all come under the same banner we forget about trans issues. Also sexuality and gender identity are two completely separate issues. Yes, gay people can support the trans community (and vice versa) but we will never truly understand what it means to question your gender identity. The label LGBTQ+ feels to me like ""Oh these people aren't 'normal' let's shove them all under the same label"".",,21,6,0

This is where things got confusing… More because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did.

I said I had no change and only had money in my card but my friend… More gave her a couple of pounds. She then turned to us and asked us for more and said to me ""there's an atm nearby, we can go there and you can withdraw the money"". At which point I walked away and didn't think much of it.

Yet, I did not see this get the kind of international attention that other mobilisations on a similar scale have gotten. We are not talking about this enough and we have to, and Indians like me who have the privilege to study abroad need to bring our friends and peers from other communities into the fold.

Besides, It feels like it is some strange whistle to the imperial times that I personally find pretty distasteful and insulting for who are very own our brothers and sisters. Specially when there are words in our beautiful language to refer to all of us such as Hispanic or Latino. Lets remember that reggeton, Borges, la cumbia, Rubén Dario, del toro, el flamenco, García Márquez, Almodovar, and other excellent land marks of culture are as equally Chilean as they are Ecuatorian as they are Mexican, Cuban or Spanish.

Not that I haven't done it or felt that way before but it isn't right. Everyone is entitle to feel a certain way but you really don't have to do it consistently on Facebook (that goes also to the people who are mourning). At the end of the day nobody truly knew who he was. No one knew him personally. Whether he rests in peace of deserved it isn't up to any of us. People are difficult and people's life are too.

I then beat myself… More up mentally because of it all. I feel like over the past year in particular (2nd year), I'm just lost within myself and that I've lost track of what I truly want in life. To top it all off, there are 2 exams in particular (out of the remaining ones I have) which I'm so anxious about (I've had a few breakdowns, periods of negative thoughts, etc.) that I continue to procrastinate studying for them, and whenever I do sit down to try and do work for those modules, I just mentally can't bring myself to do it because of how fearful I feel.

I don't like the feeling of others giving advice that contradicts with… More what I read elsewhere, and after my personally-designed gym-starter routine I indeed improve my strength (15+kg on bench press, 20~30kg+ on squat and deadlift) and their respective stabilities - but I have to admit those people, even spending much less time on exercise, can easily row the weight that I use to squat. Shall I really stop having rest day, exhaust all my workouts and go to gym everyday?
